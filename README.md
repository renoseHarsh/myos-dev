# myos-dev

This is a hobby operating system written in C and Assembly, developed from scratch. It boots in a bare-metal environment using a custom bootloader and runs on emulators like QEMU. The kernel provides basic low-level functionality and serves as a foundation for learning OS development and hardware interaction.

## ðŸ›  Build Instructions

Make sure you have a cross-compiler (e.g., `i686-elf-gcc`) installed and then run:

```bash
make
```

To run in QEMU:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -drive build/bootable.bin
```
